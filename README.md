# My-Personal-Portfolio
This portofolio represents me and my tech skills (web dev mostly), I'm going to be trying out in it  perfecting my knowledge and using it as a daily training field.

You'll notice my advancement as you scroll down the content of this website from basic to advanced, separated in sections organized by dates, showing my growth along my journey.

Feel free to use any section of code you like, or ask about how I made certain functionalities, just make sure you give me credit or any sort of reference.

I'm open to any critics or advice, you can address me on github or by any means you prefer, I thank for advance !

Enjoy Yo self :3
